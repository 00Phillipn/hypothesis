RELEASE_TYPE: minor

This release improves the :func:`~hypotheses.strategies.complex_numbers`
strategy, which now supports ``min_magnitude`` and ``max_magnitude``
arguments, along with ``allow_nan`` and ``allow_infinity`` like for
:func:`~hypotheses.strategies.floats`.

Thanks to J.J. Green for this feature.
