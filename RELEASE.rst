RELEASE_TYPE: minor

This release blocks installation of Hypothesis on Python 3.3, which
:PEP:`reached its end of life date on 2017-09-29 <398>`.

This should not be of interest to anyone but downstream maintainers -
if you are affected, migrate to a secure version of Python as soon as
possible or at least seek commercial support.
