# This benchmark is for ints [integers()], with the validity
# condition "always" and the interestingness condition "never".
# See the script for the exact definitions of these criteria.

# Key statistics for this benchmark:
#
# * 1000 examples
# * Mean size: 3200.00 bytes, standard deviation: 0.00 bytes
#
# Additional interesting statistics:
#
# * Ranging from 3200 [1000 times] to 3200 [1000 times] bytes.
# * Median size: 3200
# * 99% of examples had at least 3200 bytes
# * 99% of examples had at most 3200 bytes
#
# All data after this point is an opaque binary blob. You are not expected
# to understand it.
