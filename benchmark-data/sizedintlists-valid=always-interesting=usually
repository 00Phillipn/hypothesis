# This benchmark is for sizedintlists [integers(min_value=0, max_value=10).flatmap(lambda n: st.lists(st.integers(), min_size=n, max_size=n))], with the validity
# condition "always" and the interestingness condition "usually".
# See the script for the exact definitions of these criteria.

# This benchmark was generated with seed 385

# * Ranging from 2 [904 times] to 3362 [once] bytes.
# * Median size: 2
# * 99% of examples had at least 2 bytes
# * 99% of examples had at most 1989 bytes
