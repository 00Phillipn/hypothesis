RELEASE_TYPE: patch

This release improves the optimisation algorithm for :ref:`targeted property-based testing <targeted-search>`,
so that it will find higher quality results more reliably. Specifically, in cases where it would previously have got near a local optimum,
it will now tend to achieve the locally optimal value.
