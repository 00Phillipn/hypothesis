RELEASE_TYPE: minor

We now support writing type annotations for the tests generated by ghostwriter.
Currently, this is done by analysing the annotations of the arguments.

A `annotation` parameter is introduced to all public ghostwriter functions. If set to
`True`, the annotations will be written where possible. If set to `False` no annotations
will be written. If omitted or set to `None` it will add annotations if any of the
targeted functions has a type annotation.
