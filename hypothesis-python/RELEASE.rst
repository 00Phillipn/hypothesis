RELEASE_TYPE: minor

The :doc:`Ghostwritter <ghostwriter>` can now write tests for
:obj:`@classmethod <builtins.classmethod>` or :obj:`@staticmethod <builtins.staticmethod>`
methods, in addition to the existing support for functions and other callables
(:issue:`3318`).  Thanks to Cheuk Ting Ho for the patch.
