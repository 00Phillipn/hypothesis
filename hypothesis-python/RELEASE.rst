RELEASE_TYPE: minor

This patch updates our vendored `list of top-level domains
<https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt>`__, which is used
by the provisional :func:`~hypothesis.provisional.domains` strategy.

(did you know that gTLDs can be both `added <https://newgtlds.icann.org/en/>`__
and `removed <https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/gtld-registry-agreement-termination-2015-10-09-en>`__?)
