RELEASE_TYPE: minor

Tired of writing tests?  Or new to Hypothesis and not sure where to start?

This release is for you!  With our new :doc:`Ghostwriter functions <ghostwriter>`
and :command:`hypothesis write ...` :ref:`command-line interface <hypothesis-cli>`,
you can stop writing tests entirely... or take the source code Hypothesis
writes for you as a starting point.

This has been in the works for months, from :issue:`2118` to versions
:ref:`5.18.3 <v5.18.3>`, :ref:`5.23.5 <v5.23.5>`, and :ref:`5.23.5 <v5.23.5>` -
particular thanks to the many people who reviewed pull requests or commented on
demos, and to Timothy Crosley's :pypi:`hypothesis-auto` project for inspiration.
