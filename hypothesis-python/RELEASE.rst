RELEASE_TYPE: patch

This patch improves the packaging of the Python package by adding 
``LICENSE.txt`` to the sdist (:issue:`1311`), clarifying the minimum
supported versions of :pypi:`pytz` and :pypi:`dateutil <python-dateutil>`
(:issue:`1383`), and adds keywords to the metadata (:issue:`1520`).

Thanks to Graham Williamson (@00willo) for writing this patch at the PyCon
Australia sprints!
