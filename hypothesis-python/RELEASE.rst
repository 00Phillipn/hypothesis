RELEASE_TYPE: major

Welcome to the next major version of Hypothesis!

There are no new features here, as we release those in minor versions.
Instead, 6.0 is a chance for us to remove deprecated features (many already
converted into no-ops), and turn a variety of warnings into errors.

If you were running on the last version of Hypothesis 5.x *without any
Hypothesis deprecation warnings*, this will be a very boring upgrade.
**In fact, nothing will change for you at all.**
