RELEASE_TYPE: patch

This patch updates our vendored `list of top-level domains <https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db>`__,
which is used by the provisional :func:`~hypothesis.provisional.domains` strategy, and fixes some
incorrect examples in the docs for :func:`~hypothesis.extra.numpy.mutually_broadcastable_shapes`.
