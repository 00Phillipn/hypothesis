RELEASE_TYPE: minor

This release ensures that infinite numbers are never generated by
:func:`~hypothesis.strategies.floats` with ``allow_infinity=False``,
which could previously happen in some cases where one bound was also
provided.

The trivially inconsistent ``min_value=inf, allow_infinity=False`` now
raises an InvalidArgumentError, as does the inverse with ``max_value``.
You can still use :func:`just(inf) <hypothesis.strategies.just>` to
generate ``inf`` without violating other constraints.
