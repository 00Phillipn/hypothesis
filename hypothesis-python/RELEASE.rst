RELEASE_TYPE: patch

This patch fixes invalid annotations detected for the tests generated by
:doc:`Ghostwritter <ghostwriter>`. It will now correctly generate ``Optional``
types with just one type argument and handle union expressions inside of type
arguments correctly. Additionally, it now supports code with the
``from __future__ import annotations`` marker for Python 3.10 and newer.
