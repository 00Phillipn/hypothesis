RELEASE_TYPE: minor

This release refactors the implementation of the ``.example()`` method,
to more accurately represent the data which will be generated by
:func:`@given <hypothesis.given>`.

As a result, calling ``s.example()`` on an empty strategy ``s``
(such as :func:`~hypothesis.strategies.nothing`) now raises ``Unsatisfiable``
instead of the old ``NoExamples`` exception.
