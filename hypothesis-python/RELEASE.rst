RELEASE_TYPE: patch

This release makes a number of internal changes to the implementation of :func:`hypothesis.extra.lark.from_lark`.
These are primarily intended as a refactoring, but you may see some minor improvements to performance when generating large strings,
and possibly to shrink quality.
