RELEASE_TYPE: minor

This release deprecates the coverage-guided testing functionality,
as it has proven brittle and does not really pull its weight.

We intend to replace it with something more useful in the future,
but the feature in its current form does not seem to be worth the cost of using,
and whatever replaces it will likely look very different.
