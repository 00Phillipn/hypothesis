v0.0.1, 10/03/2013 -- Initial release. Basic working prototype. Demonstrates idea, probably shouldn't be used.
v0.0.2, 12/03/2013 -- Starting to tighten up on the internals. Change API to allow more flexibility in configuration. More testing. 
v0.0.3  13/03/2013 -- Improved a few internals. Opened up creating generators from instances as a general API. Test integration.
v0.0.4  13/03/2013 -- No changes except that I checked in a failing test case for 0.0.3 so had to replace the release. Doh
v0.0.5  13/03/2013 -- No changes except trying to fix packaging
v0.1.0  23/03/2013 -- Introduce stateful testing. Massive rewrite of internals to add flags and strategies.
v0.1.1  24/03/2013 -- Python 3.x support via 2to3. Use new style classes (oops). 
v0.1.2  24/03/2013 -- Bugfix: Stateful testing was not minimizing correctly and could throw exceptions. Features: Better support for recursive strategies. Support for named tuples. Performance: Much faster integer generation.
v0.1.3  03/05/2013 -- Bugfix: Stateful testing behaved incorrectly with subclassing. Features: Complex number support, support for recursive strategies, different error for hypotheses with unsatisfiable assumptions
v0.1.4  14/12/2013 -- Make verification runs time bounded with a configurable timeout
