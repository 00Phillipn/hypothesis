    "\n",
    "The big difference between lists of integers and the general case is that integers can never be too complex. In particular we will rapidly get to the point where individual elements can be simplified in usually only log(n) calls. When dealing with e.g. lists of lists this is a much more complicated proposition. That may be covered in another notebook.\n",
