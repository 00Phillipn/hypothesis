# Conjecture for Rust 0.1.1 (2018-06-23)

This is an essentially no-op release that just updates the package homepage and
puts this package under the Hypothesis continuous release system.

# Conjecture for Rust 0.1.0 (2018-06-19)

This is an initial empty package release of Conjecture for Rust, solely
to start fleshing out the release system and package dependency architecture
between this and Hypothesis for Ruby. It literally does nothing.
