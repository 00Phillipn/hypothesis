## Hypothesis for Ruby 0.0.6 (2018-02-19)

This release just updates the gem description.

## Hypothesis for Ruby 0.0.5 (2018-02-19)

This is a trivial release to test the release automation.
It should have no user visible impact.

## Hypothesis for Ruby 0.0.3 (2018-02-19)

This is an initial developer preview of Hypothesis for Ruby.
It's ready to use, but isn't yet stable and has significant
limitations. It is mostly released so that people can easily give
feedback on the API and implementation, and is likely to change
substantially before a stable release.

Note that while there were some earlier release numbers internally,
these were pulled. This is the first official release.
