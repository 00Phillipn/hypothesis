## Hypothesis for Ruby 0.0.1 (2018-02-19)

This is an initial developer preview of Hypothesis for Ruby.
It's ready to use, but isn't yet stable and has significant
limitations. It is mostly released so that people can easily give
feedback on the API and implementation, and is likely to change
substantially before as table release..
